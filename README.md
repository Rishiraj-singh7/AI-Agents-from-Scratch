Overview
The Multi-Agent AI App with Ollama is a Python-based application leveraging the open-source LLaMA 3.2:3b model via Ollama to perform specialized tasks through a collaborative multi-agent architecture. Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web interface, this system includes agents for summarizing medical texts, writing research articles, and sanitizing medical data (Protected Health Information - PHI). Each primary agent is paired with a corresponding validator agent to ensure the quality and accuracy of the outputs.

Features
Summarize Medical Texts: Generate concise summaries of lengthy medical documents.
Write and Refine Research Articles: Create detailed research articles based on a given topic and optional outline, followed by refinement for enhanced quality.
Sanitize Medical Data (PHI): Remove sensitive health information from medical datasets to ensure privacy compliance.
Quality Validation: Each primary task is accompanied by a validator agent to assess and ensure output quality.
Robust Logging: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging purposes.
User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction and task management.
