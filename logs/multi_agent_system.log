Sebaceous glands inside the pore of the skin produce sebum. When the outer layers of skin shed (a natural and continuous process, normally), dead skin and oily sebum left behind may bond together and form a blockage of the sebaceous gland at the base of the skin. This is most common when the skin becomes thicker at puberty.[2] The sebaceous gland continues to produce sebum, which builds up behind the blockage, allowing bacteria to grow in the area, including the species Staphylococcus aureus and Cutibacterium acnes, which causes inflammation and infection. Other causes of pimples include family history, stress, fluctuations in hormone levels, hair and skincare products, medication side effects, and un-diagnosed or underlying medical conditions.[3] Pimples can be part of the presentation of rosacea.[4]

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that adults with acne use products labeled as "non-comedogenic", "non-acnegenic", "oil-free" or "won’t clog pores", as they are "least likely" to cause skin irritation or acne.[3]

Pimples form when dead skin and sebum bond together, blocking sebaceous glands in the skin. This can happen naturally with puberty-related skin thickening. Bacteria growth leads to inflammation and infection.

2024-12-20T17:12:32.906260+0530 INFO [SummarizeValidatorAgent] Received response: Analysis:

The summary accurately captures the main points of the original text, including the formation of pimples due to blockage of sebaceous glands, the role of bacteria in causing inflammation and infection, and other contributing factors such as family history, stress, hormonal fluctuations, products, medication side effects, and underlying medical conditions.

However, the summary could be improved by including information about the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendations for adults with acne. Additionally, the original text mentions that pimples can be part of the presentation of rosacea, which is not included in the summary.

Rating: 4 out of 5

The summary effectively condenses the key points of the original text into a concise and easy-to-understand format. However, it could be improved by including more information from the original text, such as the recommendations for adults with acne and the connection to rosacea.
